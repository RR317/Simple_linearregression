# Simple_linearregression
Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

# Formula
The equation has the form Y= a + bX, 
where Y is the dependent variable (thatâ€™s the variable that goes on the Y axis), 
X is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the X axis), 
b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept.
